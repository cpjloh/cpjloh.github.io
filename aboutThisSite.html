        Oh, hi!<p>
        The following is old news. I'll update it when I have time.<br><br>
        I'm currently taking a JavaScript class this summer. JavaScript is<br>
        used for making fancier HTML webpages. When I realized I would need<br>
        an HTML webpage for flexing my JavaScript muscles...well, here we
        are!<p>
        I wrote this website entirely by hand!<br><br>

        P.S. Please enjoy my use of the tab "Recursion" to take you to<br>
        the tab you're at!
