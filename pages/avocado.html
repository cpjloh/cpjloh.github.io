            <p>My computer engineering capstone project
            aims to implement <strong>lane keeping</strong>, <strong>object
                detection and classification</strong>, and <strong>
                vehicle-to-vehicle communication</strong> to allow a platoon
            of vehicles to collaboratively respond to a dynamic roadway.</p>
            <p>My primary contributions are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lane tracking using computer vision</li>
                <li>Project management</li>
                <li>Communication between mechanical and computer engineering
                    teams</li>
            </ul>
            <p>My technical work has been <strong>utilizing
                OpenCV</strong> with <strong>Python</strong> for lane tracking.
            I have also been <strong>writing and managing system 
            processes</strong> using <strong>C++</strong>.
            Some videos of my work are below.</p>
            <p>Note: I have <em>really</em> enjoyed this project, as well as my
            computer vision course, and will ideally find work in this
            field.</p>

            <p>The above video shows my lane detection algorithm on a section of southbound
            Highway 101, north of Paso Robles. The algorithm identifies the lane lines within a
            region of interest and paints them green for programmer visibility.
            The center point tracks the center of the lane, which is used as
            input to our PID lane keeping controller.
            </p>
            <p>The following video was taken on February 16, 2019 after many
            hours of my teammate and me working on electronics and
            software. The video shows lane lines mounted on a chair (seen
            at the bottom of the frame) and a camera (on the desk). The camera
            captures video, which it feeds to the not-so-micro Jetson TX2 
            microcontroller for the necessary image processing. Finally, a 
            pwm signal is sent to an Arduino (we do this because the Arduino, 
            unlike the Jetson, has pwm hardware), which then controls 
            the vehicle.

            <p>This video, taken on February 17, 2019, shows our car driving
            on the track for time and navigating an S-bend! I was able to 
            access the car through WiFi
            (ssh) and run a script to start the vehicle. The vehicle
            navigates the roadway and I manually shut off the vehicle
            when it reaches the end of the roadway. A teammate is holding
            string tied to the car should the system fail and the car try to
            drive away (we have not yet set up the system to shut off on a
            disconnect from my laptop).
            </p>
            <p>Note that the hardware is a mess right now as it allows for easy
            access of electronics in the development phase. We'll clean it up
            over time.
