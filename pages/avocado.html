            <p>My computer engineering capstone project
            aims to implement <strong>lane keeping</strong>, <strong>object
                detection and classification</strong>, and <strong>
                vehicle-to-vehicle communication</strong> to allow a platoon
            of vehicles to collaboratively respond to a dynamic roadway.</p>
            <p>My primary contributions are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lane tracking using computer vision</li>
                <li>Project management</li>
                <li>Communication between mechanical and computer engineering
                    teams</li>
            </ul>
            <p>My technical work has been <strong>utilizing
                OpenCV</strong> with <strong>Python</strong> for lane tracking. 
            Some videos of my work are below.</p>
            <p>Note: I have <em>really</em> enjoyed this project, as well as my
            computer vision course, and will ideally find work in this
            field.</p>

            <p>The above video shows my lane detection algorithm on a section of southbound
            Highway 101, north of Paso Robles. The algorithm identifies the lane lines within a
            region of interest and paints them green for programmer visibility.
            The center point tracks the center of the lane, which is used as
            input to our PID lane keeping controller.
            </p>
            <p>The following video was taken on February 16, 2019 after many
            hours of my teammate and me working on electronics and
            software. The video shows lane lines mounted on a chair (seen
            at the bottom of the frame) and a camera (on the desk). The camera
            captures video, which it feeds to the not-so-micro Jetson TX2 
            microcontroller for the necessary image processing. Finally, a 
            pwm signal is sent to an Arduino (we do this because the Arduino, 
            unlike the Jetson, has pwm hardware), which then controls 
            the vehicle.
