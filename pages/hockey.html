            <h4 style="margin-top:0">March 2019</h4>
            <p>This autonomous hockey table was part of a project by a previous
            team. Thus, my team used the existing hardware and rewrote all the
            software. This rewrite included improved vision capabilities, faster
            PID control, and reduced noise. This was an opportunity for me to
            use <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>OpenCV</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>I was the sole author of the computer vision used in this project.
            The algorithm begins begins by thresholding the image to remove
            all pixels that are outside of a red color bounds. Next, the
            erode morphological transformation is applied to reduce the noise
            in the image and remove the red on the air hockey table. The table
            then selects the largest section of red on the table and makes a
            prediction of its future positions by using a history of its previous
            positions to approximate the puck's velocity.
            </p>
            <p>There are two issues that impacted the project's final result.
            First, the encoder values began to drift. This results in the slider
            confidentally moving to hit a puck but missing as the positioning
            system has lost accuracy. This could be improved by recalibrating
            the slider every few seconds using a position found using the
            camera. The second issue was the table's ability to play at very
            high speeds, which is the result of the puck blurring and becoming
            invisible to the algorithm. Our team wished to use a better camera,
            but unfortunately we did not have enough time.
