        Fun facts about me!
        <ul>
            <li>
                I have over a 600 day streak on Duolingo. I'm super proud
                of this streak, and I do what it takes to keep it going.<br>
                You can actually find me on 
                <a href="https://duome.eu/bronze">a leaderboard</a> for my
                streak!<br>
                (You might have to do Ctrl+F to find me.)
            </li>
            <li>I bake award-winning cookies (no joke, check the awards log
                from the 2015 Monterey County Fair).
            </li>
            <li>Biking is fun. The beach is fun. Seeing the world is fun.<br>
                Well, that's what I think.
            </li>
        </ul>
        Some not so fun facts about me--let's call it "getting down to
        business." My full works can be viewed at my

        <ul>
            <li>I'm graduating from Cal Poly (San Luis Obispo) with a degree
                in Mechanical Engineering in spring 2019.<br>
                (Don't forget mechatronics concentration and computer science 
                minor!)</li>
            <li>I like computer science!</li>
            <li>I did research this past summer at Cal Poly working with
                Professor Charles Birdsong on his autonomous vehicles
                research. In the summer of 2017 I interned at Varian
                Medical Systems, and the summer before that with the City
                of Monterey.
            </li>
            <li>
                Autonomous vehicles are becoming my thing. I never thought
                I would find myself looking at the automotive industry for
                employment, but after engaging encounters with the field
                (research, a mechatronics project, and my (computer
                engineering) Capstone Project), I've realized it's an
                amazing field with incredible opportunities.
